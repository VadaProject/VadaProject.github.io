## Introduction

The Vāda Project is a web application that teaches pramāṇa-vāda, a classic style of philosophical debate developed in ancient India and used for over a millennium.

This debate format is designed to promote critical thought and reflection through its logical structure of theses and counter.

This semester-long project was undertaken as a collaboration between students and faculty within the College of Computing and KSU philosophy department.

Developers acquired the philosophy department’s existing codebase, developed, refactored, and maintained a web-based UI and PHP+SQL server backend to deliver a well-documented and maintainable interactive platform for epistemological discussion.

## Methods
Through weekly meetings with end-users, and closely following the software development life cycle, a team of student developers delivered a codebase which emphasizes,

1. Usability and accessibility
2. Maintainability by future developers
3. Adherence to high-quality code standards

Developers applied industry best-practices (user centered design, version-control, testing, and continuous integration) to discover and meet all requirements.

## Version Control
* [View the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vadaproject/application)

To enable present and future collaboration, developers closely used a GitHub repository to track changes. Code is deployed live from this repository to the production site. GitHub Actions perform automated code quality tests.

## Results
Students and staff in the philosophy department responded very positively to UI changes, and overall code quality increased. The project is actively being used as a teaching tool. Introducing students to non-western philosophy. This project will continue on to aid philosophy students that will go into law school, legal advising, and other technical positions.
